// Sentence:
// 'If there was one remaining purpose to my life, though, this was it: to prove that the truth could always be faced â€“ explained, demystified, accepted.'

// Analogy:
// It was like a brave lion facing a fierce storm. The lion knew it was dangerous, but it was determined to stay strong and brave the storm. It was like the lion was proving to itself and the world that it could stay brave and face the truth no matter how difficult it was.

// Sentence:
// 'I was matter, like everything else. I could feel the slow decay of my body, the absolute certainty of death. Every heartbeat spelt out a new proof of mortality. Every moment was a premature burial.'

// Analogy:
// It was like a little mouse in a cage. The mouse could feel the bars of the cage closing in on it, trapping it and making it feel like it was slowly dying. Every beat of its heart was like a ticking clock, counting down the seconds until it was gone. Every moment was like a funeral, a reminder that death was inevitable.
